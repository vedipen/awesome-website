# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ description: 'Star Wars' }, { description: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(description: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Link.create(description: 'Gmail', url: 'https://gmail.com')
